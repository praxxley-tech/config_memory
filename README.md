# Dangerous PowerShell Script Warning

## Overview

This repository contains a PowerShell script that interacts with low-level Windows API functions to perform potentially dangerous operations. **Do not execute this script without a full understanding of its impact on your system.**

## Description

The script uses P/Invoke to call several Windows API functions, allowing it to perform actions such as loading libraries, retrieving addresses of functions within these libraries, modifying memory protections, and executing arbitrary code. This capability can be exploited to disable security mechanisms, inject malicious code, or perform other unauthorized actions.

The script specifically targets the Windows API to:

- Load a library dynamically.
- Retrieve the address of a function within that library.
- Change the protection on a region of memory.
- Copy arbitrary bytes to a specified memory location.
- Execute an external script from a remote source.

## Warning

### Potential Risks

- Disabling security features.
- Executing malicious code.
- Unauthorized system modification.
- Possible detection by antivirus software as malicious activity.

## Usage

1. **Review the Code**: Thoroughly review and understand the script's actions and consequences.
2. **Environment**: Only run this script in a controlled, isolated environment, such as a virtual machine not connected to a production network.
3. **Permissions**: Ensure you have the appropriate permissions to perform such actions on the system where the script is executed.
